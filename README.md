# Portfolio

A portfolio website demonstrating my acquired skills.  

# What I Learned

* SASS, baby, SASS. Another name for this project could very well be *"I'm So Sassy!"* 
  * Mixins, variables, partials, includes... I feel like I'm in the Land Of Oz.
* To never use a popular template again. This can't be predicted, though.
* Integrating a Google contact form within a website. Fastest quick fix I know.
* The painstaking process of iPhone5/SE responsiveness. Chrome Developer Tools doesn't reveal the whole picture!
